.B Simple Shell - a basic Unix Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

In order to run this program, you have to start by compiling it with:
gcc 4.8.4 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
You can now use it by invoking:
./hsh
If you want to check memory leaks use:
valgrind --leak-check=full ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION

The Simple Shell is a Holberton School project, it simulates a basic Unix Shell with its respective commands. It uses the POSIX API to implement many of the same functionalities of the first Ken Thompson's Shell.

.SH RETURN VALUE

A return command is used to exit from a shell function. It takes a parameter [N], if N is mentioned then it returns [N] and if N is not mentioned then it returns the status of the last command executed within the function or script. N can only be a numeric value. Note that echo $? can be used to display the last return status.
